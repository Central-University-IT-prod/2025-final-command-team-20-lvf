# Lottie Movie Frontend
Telegram Mini App (TMA) for [Lottie Movie](https://t.me/lottiemoviebot/app)

Based on React + [TelegramUI](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/TelegramUI) with zero extra dependencies.
## Why it is perfect?
### Optimizations
- Perfect memoization is applied when needed to prevent component re-rendering. `memo` HOC, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and other built-in technologies are utilized efficiently.  
- Bundle loading is sped up via [chunking and minification](https://REDACTED/team-20/lvf/-/blob/452934f62c0720584ed60df4530dcea9763ad321/vite.config.ts).  

Some parts of the code have been taken from my open-source projects:  
- [MyTonWallet](https://github.com/mytonwalletorg/mytonwallet)

### Extraordinary attention to detail
Spent a lot of time making sure the mini-app works perfectly on all major Telegram mobile clients - including working on color schemes and safe areas for the camera, UI system controls, etc. Also try to use Reels - it comes with auto full screen mode switching for better experience.

### Almost-native experience
The app mimics the Telegram client you're using - this includes UI components, color scheme, and animations. Try using the app on Android and iOS - two big differences.
